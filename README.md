# k8s-collector
A Kubernetes Job to collect resources, logs and events from a Kubernetes cluster.
k8s-collector is a Job that can collect both resources (YAMLs) and logs when created.

[k8s/collector.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gianlucam76/k8s_collector/main/k8s/collector.yaml) contains the YAML to run it. Please be aware you will have to modify Job volume mounts (as it will store logs and resources in tmp directory).
If you want to try it out on [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) cluster, then you can use this YAML which uses a persistent volume provided by KinD 
[test/fv/collector.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gianlucam76/k8s_collector/main/test/fv/collector.yaml)

```k8s-collector``` expects two argurments:

1. dir => this is the directory when all collected resources and logs will be stored 
2. config-map => this is the name of the ConfigMap that contain the configuration on which logs/resources to collect. This README contains an example for such ConfigMap. ConfigMap must be in the same namespae of the Job.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: k8s-collector
  namespace: default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      serviceAccountName: k8s-collector
      containers:
      - name: k8s-collector
        image: projectsveltos/k8s-collector-amd64:main
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
          - name: COLLECTOR_NAMESPACE
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.namespace
        command:
          - /k8s-collector
        args:
          - --config-map=k8s-collector
          - --dir=/collection
```

### ConfigMap example
Following is an example of ConfigMap containing the Collector configuration.
Configuration is asking for:

- v1 Secrets and appsv1 Deployments to be collected in all namespaces
- logs to be collected for all pods in the kube-system namespace. Only the last 600 seconds.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  config.yaml: '{"resources":[{"group":"","version":"v1","kind":"Secret"},{"group":"apps","version":"v1","kind":"Deployment"}],"logs":[{"namespace":"kube-system","sinceSeconds":600}]}'
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: k8s-collector
  namespace: default
```

### Collection folders
k8s-collector will create two folders:

1. ```logs``` => this will contain collected logs
2. ```resources``` => this will contain collected resources

Each directory contains one subdirectory per namespace. Sticking with above example in the ```logs``` directory we have a ```kube-system``` subdirectory (since we asked k8s-collector to collect logs in that directory only).
Then within the ```kube-system``` sudirectory there is a log per pod/container pair.
For instance

```
coredns-5dd5756b68-bb5hr-coredns	    kube-apiserver-sveltos-management-control-plane-kube-apiserver
coredns-5dd5756b68-jjknb-coredns	    kube-controller-manager-sveltos-management-control-plane-kube-controller-manager
etcd-sveltos-management-control-plane-etcd  kube-proxy-qcvbf-kube-proxy
kindnet-bf559-kindnet-cni		    kube-proxy-trk6j-kube-proxy
kindnet-qzs4f-kindnet-cni		    kube-scheduler-sveltos-management-control-plane-kube-scheduler
```

The ```resource``` subdirectory contains one directory per namespace. And within each namespace directory, there is one directory per ```Kind```
For instance, we asked k8s-collector to collect __Secret__ and __Deployment__ from any namespace, so 

```resources/cert-manager/``` contains two subdirectories:
- Deployment => all collected Deployment instances in the cert-manager namespace will be here
- Secret => all collected Secret instance in the cert-manager namespace will be here

I developed to be used along with [Sveltos](https://github.com/projectsveltos) but it can be used on its own.
